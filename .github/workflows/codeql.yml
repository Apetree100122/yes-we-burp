          Controls the level of verbosity of the CodeQL Python extractor.
          The supported levels are (in order of increasing verbosity):
            - off
            - errors
            - warnings
            - info or progress
            - debug or progress+
            - trace or progress++
            - progress+++

  python_executable_name:
    title: Controls the name of the Python executable used by the Python extractor.
    description: >
      The Python extractor uses platform-dependent heuristics to determine the name of the Python executable to use.
      Specifying a value for this option overrides the name of the Python executable used by the extractor.
      Accepted values are py, python and python3.
      Use this setting with caution, the Python extractor requires Python 3 to run.

    pattern: "^(py|python|python3)$"
